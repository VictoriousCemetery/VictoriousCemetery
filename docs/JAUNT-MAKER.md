# Jaunt Maker
----
A jaunt can consist of a "start" location, an "end" location and one or more points of interests called "stops".  A jaunt can also consist entirely of "stops".

## Creating a route
On loading of the Jaunt Maker, the default selected button is "Route".  Clicking on a location on the map will place a marker indicating the start location of the jaunt.

If you wish to initiate or end a jaunt at a location other than a "stop" make sure you click on "Route" prior to clicking on the location on the map.

In order to identify a "stop" on the jaunt, first click on the "Stop" button, then click on the location you desire anywhere on the map.  This will cause a modal window to open, allowing the user to provide detailed information regarding the stop.

The user is given the ability to select from the 5 closest businesses to the stop.  If the business/stop is not in the list of choices, select "Other" and type in the name of the business you wish to record.  Fill in as much detail as you can and when you are ready, click "Submit".

This will bring you back to the map view and allow you to either add more stops or an end location.  If you wish to add an end location that is not a "stop", select "Route" prior to clicking on the end location on the map.

Once you have finished recording your jaunt, click "Save".  This will cause the jaunt to be saved to the database.

## Analyzing a jaunt
Clicking on "Get Jaunts" will allow you to gain access to all jaunt objects that are currently in the database.  An array of jaunt objects will be presented in the console.
